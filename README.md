   - Sorts by length (longest first) for maximum points

4. **Automation** (`wordhunt.py`)
   - Uses Quartz CGEvent API for precise mouse control
   - Calculates swipe paths through grid cells
   - Handles coordinate system conversions (window ↔ screen ↔ Quartz)
   - Respects game timing constraints (1:15 round limit)

5. **GUI** (`app_cocoa.py`)
   - Native macOS Cocoa application
   - Real-time board preview
   - Word progress tracking
   - Logs and diagnostics

## Model Details

### Architecture

The letter recognition model is a Convolutional Neural Network with the following structure:

```
Input: 28×28 grayscale image
  ↓
Conv2d(1 → 32, kernel=3) + ReLU
  ↓
MaxPool2d(2×2)
  ↓
Conv2d(32 → 64, kernel=3) + ReLU
  ↓
MaxPool2d(2×2)
  ↓
Flatten → Linear(64×5×5 → 128) + ReLU
  ↓
Dropout(0.5)
  ↓
Linear(128 → 26) + LogSoftmax
  ↓
Output: 26 classes (A-Z)
```

### Training Process

1. **Dataset Creation** (`create_dataset.py`)
   - Captures game boards from iPhone Mirroring
   - Extracts individual cell images
   - Manual labeling interface with AI suggestions
   - Deduplication by image hash
   - Organizes images into `letter_dataset/A/`, `letter_dataset/B/`, etc.

2. **Model Training** (`train_model.py`)
   - 80/20 train/validation split
   - Adam optimizer with CrossEntropyLoss
   - Saves best model based on validation accuracy
   - Provides per-letter diagnostics for problematic classes
   - Typical training: 50-100 epochs

3. **Model Performance**
   - Trained on 2,400+ labeled images
   - High accuracy on letter recognition
   - Handles various lighting conditions and board states
   - Model file: `letter_recognition_model.pth` (896 KB)

### Dataset Statistics

- **Total Images**: 2,407 labeled letter samples
- **Distribution**: Varies by letter frequency (E, A, R most common; Q, Z least common)

   ```bash
   python app_cocoa.py
   ```

2. **Setup**
   - Click "Permissions" to open System Preferences
   - Grant Screen Recording and Accessibility permissions
   - Open iPhone Mirroring with Word Hunt game
   - Click "Move to Corner" to position the window

3. **Calibration** (Optional, recommended for first use)
   - Click "Calibrate"
   - Hover over center of top-left tile, wait for countdown
   - Hover over center of bottom-right tile, wait for countdown
   - Calibration is saved for future runs

4. **Solve**
   - Click "Start" to begin solving
   - Watch the dashboard for progress
   - Words are swiped automatically in optimal order

### Command Line Mode

```bash
# Interactive menu
python wordhunt.py menu

# Auto-solve (non-interactive)
python wordhunt.py solve

# Dry run (find words but don't swipe)
python wordhunt.py dry-run

# Calibration only
python wordhunt.py calibrate
```

### Testing Without iPhone Mirroring

Use `simulate_board.py` to test word finding on a typed board:

```bash
python simulate_board.py --grid "dtio fors npat lfin" --limit 50
```

## Development

### Creating a Dataset

The dataset creation tool (`create_dataset.py`) allows you to collect labeled letter images from game boards:

1. **Start dataset creation**
   ```bash
   python create_dataset.py --suggest
   ```

2. **Process boards**
   - Ensure iPhone Mirroring is open with Word Hunt game visible
   - The tool captures the current board and extracts individual cell images
   - For each cell, it displays the image and prompts for the letter label
   - Use `--suggest` flag to get AI predictions as starting point (press Enter to accept, or type the correct letter)
   - Type 'q' to quit the current board

3. **Label cells**
   - Each cell image is shown in a window
   - Enter the correct letter (A-Z) for each cell
   - Images are automatically saved to `letter_dataset/<LETTER>/` folders
   - Duplicate images are detected and skipped using content hashing

4. **Continue with more boards**
   - After labeling all 16 cells, you'll be prompted to process another board
   - Type 'y' to continue or 'n' to finish
   - More boards provide better training data diversity

5. **Dataset organization**
   - Images are saved as `letter_dataset/A/A_000001.png`, `letter_dataset/B/B_000001.png`, etc.
   - Each letter folder contains all labeled images for that letter
   - The tool maintains an index to avoid duplicate filenames

### Training Your Own Model

1. **Train model**
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
   - Automatically splits data into train/validation (80/20)
   - Saves best model to `letter_recognition_model.pth` based on validation accuracy
   - Shows per-letter accuracy diagnostics to identify problematic classes
   - Typical training: 50-100 epochs

2. **Test model**
   - Run solver with new model
   - Check accuracy on real boards
   - Add more training data for problematic letters if needed

## Technical Details

### Coordinate Systems

The solver handles three coordinate systems:

1. **Window Coordinates**: Top-left origin, relative to iPhone Mirroring window
2. **Screen Coordinates**: Top-left origin, absolute screen position (pyautogui)
3. **Quartz Coordinates**: Bottom-left origin, macOS native (CGEvent)

The solver converts between these systems for accurate mouse control.

### Board Detection Algorithm

1. Crop image to likely board region (45%-85% of height)
2. Convert to HSV color space
3. Create green mask (H: 35-85, S: 40-255, V: 40-255)
4. Apply morphological operations (close + open)
5. Find largest contour (the board)
6. Calculate grid cell positions from bounding box
7. Optionally refine using tan tile detection

### Word Finding Algorithm

1. Build Trie from dictionary (compresses 'qu' → 'q' for QU tiles)
2. For each starting cell:
   - Perform DFS in all 8 directions
   - Track visited cells to avoid reuse
   - Check Trie for valid word completions
3. Sort results by length (descending), then alphabetically
4. Calculate potential score using Word Hunt scoring rules

### Scoring System

- 3 letters: 100 points
- 4 letters: 400 points
- 5 letters: 800 points
- 6 letters: 1,400 points
- 7 letters: 1,800 points
- 8 letters: 2,200 points
- 9+ letters: 2,600 + (length - 9) × 400 points

## Troubleshooting

### Board Not Detected

- Ensure iPhone Mirroring window is visible
- Check that game board is fully visible (not covered)
- Try calibration for better accuracy
- Adjust `WORDHUNT_MARGIN_*_RATIO` environment variables

### Letters Misrecognized

- Run calibration to improve board detection
- Check lighting conditions
- Train model with more data for problematic letters
- Use `--suggest` flag in dataset creation to improve labeling

### Swipes Not Working

- Verify Accessibility permission is granted
- Check that iPhone Mirroring window is focused
- Ensure game is in active play state
- Try "Move to Corner" button to reposition window

### Model Not Found

- Ensure `letter_recognition_model.pth` is in the same directory
- Check file permissions
- Re-download from repository if missing
